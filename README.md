The [Lojban][0] language is supposed to be machine-parsable, so let's use that to make the language easier to understand!  Here are a few features that would aid in communication:

* Syntax highlighting.
* Dialect rewriting.
* Core meaning extraction.

Most of the Lojban conversations happen on the [roljbogu'e Discord server][1].  Join us there!
